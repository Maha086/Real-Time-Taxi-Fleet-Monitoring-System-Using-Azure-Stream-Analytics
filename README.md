# Project Overview :
This project focuses on real-time analytics to monitor cab services like Uber and Ola. With the growing demand for these services, real-time analytics helps businesses quickly identify trends, opportunities, and issues. Unlike batch analytics, which can take hours or days to deliver insights, real-time analytics enables businesses to act instantly. 
The system involves a 3-step process: **Ingest, Analyze, and Deliver**.

# Aim :
The aim of this project is to create a real-time system that tracks cab bookings, processes the data using Azure technologies, and shows insights on a Power BI dashboard. This will help businesses make quick decisions and improve their service.
# Objective :
The objective is to gain hands-on experience in real-time analytics, event processing, and data visualization using Azure technologies while demonstrating proficiency in building scalable and efficient stream processing pipelines for monitoring and analyzing cab service data.
# Tech Stack :
Language: SQL, C#
# Services: 
Azure VM, Docker, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Event Hubs, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Power BI
# Implementation Plan
Step 1: Set up an Azure Resource Group

Step 2: Create an Event Hub for Data Ingestion

Step 3: Configure and Run a Generator Code on Azure VM

Step 4: Use Azure Stream Analytics to Process Data

Step 5: Derive Insights and Trends (Data transformation)

Step 6: Store Processed Data in Cosmos DB

Step 7: Connect Power BI to Cosmos DB (Visualization)

Step 8: Implement Azure Monitor for Pipeline Monitoring

**Data pipeline** - A data pipeline is a series of steps that automatically moves, processes, and stores data from one system to another, making it ready for analysis or use.

 **Azure VM** is a scalable, on-demand computing resource in the cloud, offering more control over your computing environment. It provides virtualization without needing to buy or maintain physical hardware. However, you are responsible for configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on the VM.

**Azure Stream Analytics** is a real-time analytics service that processes large amounts of streaming data from various sources to identify patterns and correlations. It can trigger actions like alarms, report generation, or data storage based on the insights.

**Azure Event Hubs** is a high-performance data streaming platform that can handle millions of events per second, allowing real-time processing or storage of data through analytics providers or adapters.

 **Power BI** is a tool that helps you create interactive reports and dashboards to visualize and analyze your data.
 
# Note : 
For optimal scalability and flexibility in managing unstructured data, please choose NoSQL (previously known as Core SQL) in Azure Cosmos DB.
